                    <h3> Rainbow Flag meaning </h3>
                    <p> The rainbow flag was popularised as a symbol of the gay community in San Francisco in 1978. The different colours are associated with diversity in queer communities. The colours are determined to symbolise the following:
                    <ul>
                      <li> Red means life
                      <li> Orange means healing
                      <li> Yellow means sunlight
                      <li> Green means nature
                      <li> Blue means harmony/peace
                      <li> Purple means spirit
                    </ul>
                    <p>Pink, white, brown and black have also been added to pride flags recently, with pink representing sex; white representing peace; and brown and black representing people of colour.
