  <h2>Referendum Background</h2>

</br>
<p>The referendum was scheduled after judges deemed the current legislation towards same-sex marriage as un-democratic. The lawmakers gave the Taiwanese government two years to enact legislative reform to allow same-sex marriage. The Taiwanese Government scheduled a referendum to put same-sex marriage to the vote. Taiwan was hopeful that the referendum result would pave the way for representing the first country in Asia to allow same-sex marriage. However, when put to the people, this was voted against. This represented a massive defeat for the LGBT+ community in Taiwan.</p>

  <h2>For & Against</h2>
  <img src="Images/TongzhiHotlineAssociation.jpg" style= "height: 300px; width:500px">
  <h3><strong>Supporters</strong></h3>
  <p>Tongzhi Hotline Association was founded in 1998 and has had a profound influence on promoting LGBT+ rights. In addition to this, Taiwan's first female president was elected in 2016, Tsai Ing-wen and she has announced her continuing support for same-sex marriage.</p>
  <h3><strong>Defenders</strong></h3>
  <p>Family Guardian Coalition consists of many of Taiwan's Christian denominations. It was organised in 2013 to pressure legislators against the proposed amendments to the civil code to legalise same-sex marriage.</p>

  <h2>History - Latest Events</h2>
  <p>Taiwan is ranked as 74th in the world's most liberal and gay-friendly countries to visit. Similarly, Taiwan have been regarded as some of the most progressive in East Asia and Asia in general. Both male and female same-sex sexual activities are legal; however, same-sex couples and households headed by same-sex couples are not yet eligible for the legal protections available to opposite-sex couples.</p>
  <p>Taiwan celebrates gay pride parade annually. The parade was first held in 2003 and the primary location has always been the captial city of Taipei. The parade held in October 2015 attracted more than 78,000 participants, making it the largest gay pride event in East Asia.</p>
  <p>This yearâ€™s LGBT+  event took place a month before the vote on same-sex marriage, which took place on November 24. The result of this referendum unfortunately was not agreed by most voters. However, this event does not let people who support LGBT+ down but instead has made the community stronger and reunite in order to help same-sex marriage be approved legislatively in the future.</p>
