    <h2>Referendum Background</h2>
    <p>The referendum was scheduled after judges deemed the current legislation towards same-sex marriage as un-democratic. The lawmakers gave the Taiwanese government two years to enact legislative reform to allow same-sex marriage. The Taiwanese Government scheduled a referendum to put same-sex marraige to the vote. Taiwan was hopeful that the referendum result would pave the way for representing the first country in Asia to allow same-sex marriage. However, when put to the people, this was voted against. This represented a massive defeat for the LGBT+ community in Taiwan.</p>
